- XML files names MUST be in lowercase
- "layout-land" folder under res folder with same xml file names will auto handle by android when user rotates phone to landscape
	- Alternate is setting layout weight for elements that need it.

- On create is entry point
- R.java has element id memory locations and is auto generated
- Can specify in XML the onclick method rather than assigning during on create
- Register dialogs with android system so everything on phone is not blocked. Ex dialog up but can still recieve call.

- onCreateOptionsMenu is for settings menu


- Fragments should be used over showDialog
- Have to show xml view before attaching listeners to objects in that view
- Settings->dev options-> way at the bottom is "don't save activities" which will trigger onDestroy()
